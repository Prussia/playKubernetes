## CoreOS Description

CoreOS Container Linux automates software updates to ensure better security and reliability of machines and containers running on large-scale clusters. 

Operating system updates and security patches are regularly pushed to Container Linux machines without requiring manual intervention by administrators. System files are always read-only, and every update can be rolled back using an active-passive partition scheme. When applications are distributed, these automatic updates dramatically improve security without causing service downtime.

Instead of installing packages with yum or apt, Container Linux deploys and manages applications in containers. Application code and dependencies are packaged in a container that runs on one or many Container Linux machines. Applications are isolated from operating system dependencies so they can be independently updated more frequently.
