**Master**: The machine that controls Kubernetes nodes. This is where all task assignments originate.

**Node**: These machines perform the requested, assigned tasks. The Kubernetes master controls them.

**Pod**: A group of one or more containers deployed to a single node. All containers in a pod share an IP address, IPC, hostname, and other resources. Pods abstract network and storage away from the underlying container. This lets you move containers around the cluster more easily.

**kubectl**: This is the command line configuration tool for Kubernetes.
